Introduction:
PEAR assembles the illumina paired-end reads if the DNA frament sizes 
are smaller than twice of the read length. PEAR can assemble 95% of the 
mean overlaps 35bp reads with a false-positive rate of 0.004. PEAR also 
works with the multiplexed data set where the true underlying DNA frament 
sizes varies. PEAR has an exremly low false-positive rate of 0.0003 on 
data set where there are no overlaps between the two reads.

How to complie:
1. Go to the src folder
2. type: make

Run self-tests:
1. Make sure you have python 2.4 or above installed
1. Go to the "test" folder
2. type: ./test.py
This will run pear on serveral simulated data sets and various options 
to check if the newly complied program works properly.  

How to use:
PEAR can robustly assemble most of the data sets with default parameters, 
a typical command to run PEAR would be:

./pear -f forward_read.fastq -r reverse_read.fastq -o outputfile

For further options, please type: ./pear -h  

Important:
1. The input files must be in FASTQ format

2. The program does not check the paired-end reads names, the users 
should make sure the reads in both files are in the same flowcell 
position if they are in the same line.
